This article in the Syncfusion Blog explains The heighest paid female athletes in terms of total earnings in 2023 using .NET MAUI Stacked Bar Chart
## Stacked Bar Chart
A stacked bar chart visually represents different categories, with bars divided into segments corresponding to subcategories or components. These subcategories are stacked, offering a snapshot of the total value and its distribution. Stacked bar charts are effective for displaying category size and the contribution of each subcategory.
To render a Stacked Bar Chart, create an instance of [StackedColumnSeries](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.StackingColumnSeries.html), and add it to the [Series](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.SfCartesianChart.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_SfCartesianChart_Series) collection property of [SfCartesianChart](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.SfCartesianChart.html?tabs=tabid-1). Then transpose the chart, by setting true to [IsTransposed](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.SfCartesianChart.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_SfCartesianChart_IsTransposed) property in [SfCartesianChart](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.SfCartesianChart.html?tabs=tabid-1).
